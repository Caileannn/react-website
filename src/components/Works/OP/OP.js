              Online Persona was a work created to visualise how media can shape
              and augment our perception of an individual, their relationships
              and their immediate environment. I wanted to create a work that
              reflected the influence and significance of the media we surround
              ourselves with and consume daily ‚Äì bringing awareness to the
              divide between the physical and virtual world, and the effects it
              can have on an individual if that divide becomes indefinite.
              ONLINE_PERSONA was created through a type of Machine Learning
              Algorithm called a Generative Adversarial Network, which is a tool
              used to generate artificial facial images from a particular image
              dataset. For this project, a set of images, which consisted of
              portraits captured during an online browsing session was used as
              input to then be trained on by the algorithm. The final work is a
              result of multiple days of training and fine-tuning of the
              dataset, producing these distorted and surrealist avatars.
