              <p>
                MEMORY BANK is an exploration of video feedback and screen
                burn-in. The inspiration behind the work was drawn from the
                phenomenon of the ghost-image or screen burn-in that occurs in
                older electronic display devices such as the CRT-type monitors,
                where the non-uniform use of pixels is a result of prolonged
                exposure of non-moving images creates ghost-like images from the
                static objects. MEMORY BANK is a collection of stills produced
                by various image processing techniques, which were designed
                specifically to mimic the effects of screen burn-in.

                The project is also an exercise in understanding computational
                memory while experimenting with alternative modes of memory and
                how it processes and stores information â€“ showcasing a different
                abstraction of reality through familiar locations and objects
                around the city of Limerick.
